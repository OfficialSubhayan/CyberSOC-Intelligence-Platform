# 🛡️ CyberSOC Intelligence Platform

An AI-powered Security Operations Center (SOC) dashboard designed to help security analysts investigate, manage, and analyze cybersecurity incidents through an interactive dashboard integrated with Google's Gemini AI.

---

## 📌 Overview

CyberSOC Intelligence Platform is a Python-based Security Operations Center (SOC) application that combines traditional incident management with Artificial Intelligence.

The platform enables analysts to:

- View and manage security incidents
- Store and retrieve incidents from a MySQL database
- Perform AI-assisted incident analysis
- Ask security-related questions using Google Gemini
- Monitor incident information through an intuitive dashboard

This project demonstrates how AI can enhance SOC workflows by providing intelligent insights during security investigations.
